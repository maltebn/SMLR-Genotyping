% Note: If we try to use the 'subfiles' package to insert the supplementary contents into this file,
%       then the \fancyhead with the "SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL" text is NOT printed on page 8 and 9.
%       This seems to be a bug in the 'subfiles' package, because internally '\subfile{}' is using
%       the basic TeX function '\input{}' and when using this function directly, the header prints
%       just fine. If using the 'subfiles' package, the header also prints fine when the subfile
%       with the supplementary contents is compiled as a standalone. Therefore, it seems like a bug
%       that some headers don't render as expected when using '\subfile{}' from a main file.
%       To have everything compile correctly (also in draft mode when the supplementary material is
%       output in the same pdf as the main article), '\input{}' is used for the supplementary material.

% Set to \blindedfalse or \blindedtrue for non-blinded or blinded mode:
\blindedfalse
% Blinded: Removes author details from frontmatter and replaces other identifying information with placeholders.
%          Adds linenumbers at every fifth line in main text.
% Non-blinded: Prints author and identifying information. No line numbers.

% We only want to compile the supplementary material as standalone assuming submission mode.
% In the preamble, the submission mode is toggled on by default, so we don't need to do it in this file.
