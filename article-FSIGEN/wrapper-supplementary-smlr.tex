% Supplementary material wrapper %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Note: While this wrapper has the structure of a main file for the supplementary material, it
% isn't intended to be compiled. Instead, compile Supplementary-material-smlr.tex as a standalone.
% Reason: There seems to be a bug somewhere (probably the 'subfiles' package), since the defined
% \fancyhead with the "SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL" text is NOT printed on page 8 and 9 when the wrapper
% is compiled, but is printed fine when compiling the subfile as standalone.
% The header is also printed as expected when this wrapper is compiled using \input{} instead
% of \subfile{} (with Supplementary-material-smlr.tex changed accordingly), so things point in the
% direction of a minor bug in the 'subfiles' package.
