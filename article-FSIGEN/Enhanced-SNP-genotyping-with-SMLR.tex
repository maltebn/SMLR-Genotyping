%% Supplementary material
% If submission mode is toggleg on, the supplementary material should NOT be included in
% the same pdf as the main article, but should be generated in one or more separate file(s).
% However, if in draft mode (non-submission mode), the supplementary material is inserted
% into the same pdf (after the main article) for easier editing.
\ifsubmission\else
  \clearpage
  % Note: Use \clearpage and NOT \newpage, since
  % the former flushes floating elements (like figures and tables) while the latter don't.
  % By using \clearpage, floating elements are then forced to appear BEFORE the \clearpage.

%% Note: Most publishers want the supplementary material and the main article to be uploaded as two separate files.
%% The publishers will then typically only care about typesetting the main article to match their layout while the supplementary material will just be made available as the file(s) the corresponding author has uploaded.
%% Many articles are generated with clickable reference links, e.g., by use of the 'doi'-package, but when the main article and the supplementary material are separate files, links from the one file to the other will be broken and behave weird.
%% This explains why Elsevier forces the authors to manually type references from the main article to the supplementary material: to avoid dead reference links (which will appear annoying and amateurish to readers).
%% The referencing logic defined in the preamble for this document was designed to help the author in the transition from editing versions to review/submission versions, such that the manual typing of references to supplementary figures, tables, equations etc. becomes easier and reduces the risk of mistyped references.
